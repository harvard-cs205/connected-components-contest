## To get started
Clone this repository.

Download these files:
  * https://s3.amazonaws.com/Harvard-CS205/wikipedia/links.npz  
  * https://s3.amazonaws.com/Harvard-CS205/wikipedia/titles-sorted.txt  

Links is an (130148107, 2) array of np.uint32_t, generated by
preprocess_to_npz.py.  Self-links have been removed.

You can run the code with "python connected.py".

## To submit new algorithms
To submit a new algorithm, send mail to staff@cs205.org with your new
.pyx file.  You can use any OpenMP constructs you would like to.  If
you need AVX (or some other build change), contact us, we will discuss.

Times will be collected on dual Xeon machine (X5550, 2.67GHz, 4 cores
each, 2 hardware threads per core, 16-threads total).  We'll run
through the data 10 times (as in connected.py), and report the total
time, above.

We may use other datasets, in the future.

Be sure to give your submission a catchy name.
